  "description": "The shared task of CoNLL-2003 concerns language-independent named entity recognition. We will concentrate on\nfour types of named entities: persons, locations, organizations and names of miscellaneous entities that do\nnot belong to the previous three groups.\n\nThe CoNLL-2003 shared task data files contain four columns separated by a single space. Each word has been put on\na separate line and there is an empty line after each sentence. The first item on each line is a word, the second\na part-of-speech (POS) tag, the third a syntactic chunk tag and the fourth the named entity tag. The chunk tags\nand the named entity tags have the format I-TYPE which means that the word is inside a phrase of type TYPE. Only\nif two phrases of the same type immediately follow each other, the first word of the second phrase will have tag\nB-TYPE to show that it starts a new phrase. A word with tag O is not part of a phrase. Note the dataset uses IOB2\ntagging scheme, whereas the original dataset uses IOB1.\n\nFor more details see https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/ and https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419\n",
